# Hi, I'm trylks

I know I said that [creating content](https://trylks.medium.com/so-you-want-to-create-content-cef8b570b0cb) is unlikely to be the best use of your time.
Ironically, if you are here, it is most likely because I keep procrastinating by creating content, which I do today in
primarily three places:
[Medium](https://trylks.medium.com/),
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/trylks),
and [Steemit](https://steemit.com/@trylks),
and in the past in a number of places not worth listing.
If it is not for content, chances are you are here for some code I shared in [GitHub](https://github.com/trylks/).

I like to think that the result of my procrastination is helpful for people,
If that is the case, please leave a comment on any of the social networks linked in this page.

Finally, if you want to incentivize my procrastination, and point it in some particular direction,
[coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/trylks) is the best way to direct my procrastination,
I would greatly appreciate knowing that my time was not completely wasted.
