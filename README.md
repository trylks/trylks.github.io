# gatsby-test
Trying gatsby before doing something big with it

how I did this (following the instructions at: https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-minimal/

```
npm i -g gatsby-cli
npm init gatsby
npm run develop
```


At this point I wanted to use:

1. Sass: covered by gatsby, that is good
1. CoffeeScript: in theory covered by Gatsby, but it has a warning: "CoffeeScript + React is a troubled combination".
   So I may compile CoffeeScript to JavaScript myself, why not?
